Example 1: According to the Tournament Regulations of an event, the time control is 30 minutes for the whole game and 30 seconds increment for each move. That is: for 60 moves we would get 30'+ (30""x 60) = 30' +30' = 60'. Then such a game is considered to be standard chess.
As according to Article A1 ""A Rapid Chess"" is a game where all moves must be completed in more than 10 minutes and less than 60 minutes for each player.
Example 2: According to the Tournament Regulations of an event, the time control is 10 minutes for the whole game and 5 seconds increment for each move. That is: for 60 moves we would get 10'+ (5' x 60) = 10' +5' = 15'. So according to Article A.1 such a game is considered to be Rapid Chess.
When doing these calculations games using delays are treated in the same way.

How does the knight move according to FIDE Laws?	"## Article 3: The Moves of the Pieces
- 3.1 It is not permitted to move a piece to a square occupied by a piece of the same colour.
- 3.1.1 If a piece moves to a square occupied by an opponent's piece the latter is captured and removed from the chessboard as part of the same move.
- 3.1.2 A piece is said to attack an opponent's piece if the piece could make a capture on that square according to Articles 3.2 to 3.8.
- 3.1.3 A piece is considered to attack a square even if this piece is constrained from moving to that square because it would then leave or place the king of its own colour under attack.
Being pinned against its own king does not stop a piece from attacking the squares it could otherwise move to. Even a pinned piece can 'check' the opponent's king.
- 3.2 The bishop may move to any square along a diagonal on which it stands.
<!-- image -->
Initially, each player has two bishops, one of which moves on light squares, the other one on dark squares. If a player has two (or more) bishops on squares of the same colour, it must be that the second bishop is the result of a promotion (See article 3.7.3.5), or an illegal move was played.

How should a player correctly offer a draw?	"## Article 9: The Drawn Game
- 9.1 Draw offers and event regulations:
- 9.1.1 The regulations of an event may specify that players cannot offer or agree to a draw, whether in less than a specified number of moves or at all, without the consent of the arbiter.
If a competition applies this rule, then the required number of moves or the no agreement at all condition, should be communicated to the players in the invitation to the tournament. It is advisable for the arbiter to repeat the rule before the start of the tournament. It is clear that the rule applies only for draw agreements. Articles 9.2,
9.3 and 9.6 still apply during the whole game and give the possibility to the players to draw in less than the specified number of moves, which must be accepted by the arbiter. For example, if two players claim a draw by three-fold occurrence after 20 moves, in a tournament where there is a draw restriction rule before 30 moves have been completed by both players, then the arbiter must allow the draw. If neither player claims a draw by three-fold occurrence, and an arbiter is aware that the same position (per 9.2.2) has occurred at least 5 times, then he/she must intervene, see Article 9.6.1.
This article does not specify a penalty in case of its violation. Unless the tournament regulations specifies one, the arbiter may act according to art. 12.9.
- 9.1.2 However, if the regulations of an event allow a draw agreement the following shall apply:"	"## Article 9: The Drawn Game

What are the arbiter's duties during a rapid or blitz tournament?	"- A.2 Players do not need to record the moves, but do not lose their rights to claims normally based on a scoresheet. The player can, at any time, ask the arbiter to provide him/her with a scoresheet, in order to write the moves.
Players are allowed to record the moves, but they may stop recording any time they wish. Players may claim a draw without the support of a scoresheet when they are playing on electronic boards. The arbiter also has the right to accept or refuse a claim without scoresheet evidence based on his/her observations.

If a player asks the Arbiter to show him the score sheet, the clock should not be paused.
If the Competition Rules are used they must apply to every round. They cannot be introduced, for example, only for the final.
- A.5 Otherwise the following apply:

How is checkmate defined according to FIDE rules?	"## Article 5: The Completion of the Game
- 5.1.1 The game is won by the player who has checkmated his/her opponent's king. This immediately ends the game, provided that the move producing the checkmate position was in accordance with Article 3 and Articles 4.2 - 4.7.
- 5.1.2 The game is lost by the player who declares he/she resigns (this immediately ends the game), unless the position is such that the opponent cannot checkmate the player's king by any possible series of legal moves. In this case the result of the game is a draw.
A player may resign in a number of different ways:
- -pausing the clock
- -announcing his/her resignation
- -knocking over his/her king
- -reaching out his/her hand to the opponent
- -signing the score sheets, and so on.
All of these possibilities are capable of being misinterpreted. Therefore, the situation has to be clarified.
At the end of a game the arbiter should ensure that both scoresheets show the same result. A player who does not wish to continue a game and leaves without resigning - or notifying the arbiter - is being discourteous. He/She may be penalized, at the discretion of the Chief Arbiter, for poor sportsmanship.
- 5.2.1 The game is drawn when the player to move has no legal move and his/her king is not in check. The game is said to end in 'stalemate'. This immediately ends the game, provided that the move producing the stalemate position was in accordance with Article 3 and Articles 4.2 - 4.7."	"## Article 5: The Completion of the Game

How much time is added after each move in a rapid game?	"However, there is the possibility for an arbiter or an organizer to specify in advance (in the regulations of the event) a less severe penalty for a violation of this article (perhaps a fine). They can also include in the regulations of the event the possibility of bringing such a device to the tournament provided that certain conditions are fulfilled: that it is completely switched off and stored in a separate bag, so that it is not in contact with the player and the player does not have access to the bag during the game, without the arbiter's permission (and he/she cannot take the bag with him to the toilet, and so on.).
A player who arrives after the start of a round should be given the opportunity to store his/her device before playing their first move, either with the organiser or placed in a bag, if this is allowed."
What is the penalty for making an illegal move?	"If a game with reversed colours has ended by normal means (for example checkmate, resignation or draw by agreement), in less than ten (10) moves by both players, then the result stands.
- 7.4 Displaced pieces:
- 7.4.1 If a player displaces one or more pieces, he/she shall re-establish the correct position in his/her own time.
- 7.4.2 If necessary, either the player or h i s / h e r opponent shall pause the chessclock and ask for the arbiter's assistance.
- 7.4.3 The arbiter may penalise the player who displaces the pieces.
Player A's clock is running when Player B accidentally displaces a piece. Player A should not restart Player B's clock but should pause the clock and summon the arbiter. The arbiter may then either add time to A's clock or subtract time from B's clock. If A restarts B's clock this creates several problems with increments being wrongly added and the move counter affected.
Most problems happen in Rapid Chess or Blitz. The penalty should be according to Article 12.9. A player should not be forfeited immediately for accidentally displacing a piece. If he/she did it deliberately, perhaps in order to gain time, or does it several times, that is different.
- 7.5 Illegal moves:
- 7.5.1 An illegal move is completed once the player has pressed his/her clock. If during a game it is found that an illegal move has been completed, the position immediately before the irregularity shall be reinstated. If the position immediately before the irregularity cannot be determined, the game shall continue from the last identifiable position prior to the irregularity. Articles 4.3 and 4.7 apply to the move replacing the illegal move. The game shall then continue from this reinstated position."

How does the arbiter handle displacement of pieces?	"It is very important that the irregularity must be discovered during the game. After the players have signed the scoresheets or it is clear in another way that the game is over, corrections are not possible. The result stands.
When the irregularity is discovered during the game the game, the game restarts from the restored position. The 'touch move' rule applies so the piece to be played should be, if possible, the one first touched, either the piece illegally moved or the piece captured.
If the irregularity was caused by a check being missed the touched piece should be used to block the check or capture the checking piece, if possible.
A move cannot be declared illegal until the player has completed his/her move by pressing his/her clock. So, the player can correct his/her move without being penalized, even if he/she had already released the piece on the board, provided he/she hasn't pressed the clock. Of course, he/she must comply with the relevant parts of article 4.
If an arbiter observes an illegal move he/she must always intervene immediately. He/She should not wait for a claim to be submitted by a player.
- 7.5.2 If the player has moved a pawn to the furthest distant rank, pressed the clock, but not replaced the pawn with a new piece, the move is illegal. The pawn shall be replaced by a queen of the same colour as the pawn.
- 7.5.3 If the player presses the clock without making a move, it shall be considered and penalised as if an illegal move.
If a player restarts the opponent's clock instead of pausing it an arbiter may regard this as an accident and punish it less severely.
For example: Player B makes an illegal move. Player A, instead of pausing the clock, restarts the opponent's clock. Is this an infringement of Article 7.5.3?"

What are the exact conditions for a valid en passant capture?	"## 0. Introduction
- 0.1 The following regulations may be altered by the FIDE Council upon recommendation of the Qualification Commission (QC). For tournaments, changes will apply to those starting on or after the date upon which they become effective.
- 0.2 The tournaments to be rated shall be pre-registered by the federation in whose territory it is held and they will be responsible for the submission of results and rating fees. Council may additionally designate these rights and responsibilities to Affiliated Organisations that are representing an autonomous territory which is contained within no more than one Federation.
The tournament and its playing schedule must be registered:
- 0.2.1 Not later than 30 days before the tournament starts, if one of the players in the tournament is rated in excess of 2700, or a female player rated in excess of 2500.

What is the 50-move rule for claiming a draw?	"- 9.2.2 has just appeared, and the player claiming the draw has the move.

- 9.2.3.2 a king had castling rights with a rook that has not been moved, but forfeited these after moving. The castling rights are lost only after the king or rook is moved.
Only the player whose move it is, and whose clock is running, is allowed to claim a draw in this way. If the procedure of a draw claim is correct, but the player forgets or doesn't know that he/she shall write his/her intended move, it is advisable that instead of rejecting the claim, the arbiter says 'Make your claim legal', if the player asks how he/she can make his/her claim legal, the arbiter can, according to article 11.2, explains conditions of a correct claim.
The correctness of a claim must be checked in the presence of both players. It is also advisable to replay the game and not to decide by only using the score sheets. If electronic boards are used it is possible to check it on the computer.
- 9.3 The game is drawn, upon a correct claim by a player having the move, if:
- 9.3.1 he/she indicates his/her move, which cannot be changed, by writing it on the paper scoresheet or entering it on the electronic scoresheet and declares to the arbiter his/her intention to make this move which will result in the last 50 moves by each player having been made without the movement of any pawn and without any capture, or"	"- 9.2.2 has just appeared, and the player claiming the draw has the move.

- 8.1.1 In the course of play each player is required to record his/her own moves and those of his/her opponent in the correct manner, move after move, as clearly and legibly as possible, in one of the following ways:
- 8.1.1.1 by writing in the algebraic notation (Appendix C), on the paper 'scoresheet' prescribed for the competition.
- 8.1.1.2 by entering moves on the FIDE certified 'electronic scoresheet' prescribed for the competition.
- 8.1.2 It is forbidden to record the moves in advance, unless the player is claiming a draw according to Article 9.2, or 9.3 or adjourning a game according to Guidelines I.1.1
Notice that it is normally forbidden to record the move before playing it. Only in the case of a draw claim (Article 9.2. and 9.3) and adjourning is it allowed to do so.
Even if an opponent has only one legal move, this must not be recorded by the player in advance
- 8.1.3 A player may reply to his/her opponent's move before recording it, if he/she so wishes. He/She must record his/her previous move before making another.
- 8.1.4 The scoresheet shall be used only for recording the moves, the times of the clocks, offers of a draw, matters relating to a claim and other relevant data.
- 8.1.5 Both players must record the offer of a draw on the scoresheet with a symbol (=)."	"## Article 8: The Recording of the Moves

What are the conditions for a draw by insufficient material?	"- 5.2.2 The game is drawn when a position has arisen in which neither player can checkmate the opponent's king with any series of legal moves. The game is said to end in a 'dead position'. This immediately ends the game, provided that the move producing the position was in accordance with Article 3 and Articles 4.2 - 4.7.
- 5.2.3 The game is drawn upon agreement between the two players during the game, provided both players have made at least one move. This immediately ends the game.
This rule is applicable, only if Article 9.1.1 (not to agree to a draw before a specified number of moves by each player) is not in effect.
The best way to conclude a game is to write down the result on the score sheet (if there is any, see Article 8) and for both players to sign it. This then forms a legal document, but even then, things can go wrong."

What are the arbiter's options when a player disturbs the opponent?	"However, there is the possibility for an arbiter or an organizer to specify in advance (in the regulations of the event) a less severe penalty for a violation of this article (perhaps a fine). They can also include in the regulations of the event the possibility of bringing such a device to the tournament provided that certain conditions are fulfilled: that it is completely switched off and stored in a separate bag, so that it is not in contact with the player and the player does not have access to the bag during the game, without the arbiter's permission (and he/she cannot take the bag with him to the toilet, and so on.).
A player who arrives after the start of a round should be given the opportunity to store his/her device before playing their first move, either with the organiser or placed in a bag, if this is allowed."

What are the default time penalties an arbiter can give?	"## A.5.5 The arbiter shall also call a flag fall, if he/she observes it.
- A.6 The regulations of an event shall specify whether Article A.4 or Article A.5 shall apply for the entire event.

## Appendix B. Blitz
- B.1 A 'blitz' game is one where all the moves must be completed in a fixed time of 10 minutes or less for each player; or the allotted time plus 60 times any increment is 10 minutes or less for each player .
According to the Tournament Regulations of an event the time control is 5 minutes for the whole game and 5 seconds increment for each move That is: for 60 moves we would get 5'+ (5'x60) = 5'+5' = 10'. According to Art. B.1 we have a Blitz game.
- B.2 The Competition Rules shall apply if:
- B.2.1 one arbiter supervises one game and
- B.2.2 each game is recorded by the arbiter or his/her assistant and, if possible, by electronic means.
- B.2.3 The player may at any time, when it is his/her move, ask the arbiter or his/her assistant to show him/her the scoresheet. This may be requested a maximum of five times in a game. More requests shall be considered as a distraction of the opponent.
If the Competition Rules are used, they must apply to every round. They cannot be introduced, for example, only for the final.
In both Blitz and Rapid Chess, if the player asks from the Arbiter to see the score sheet, the clock should not be paused.
- B.3 Otherwise, play shall be governed by the Rapid chess Laws as in Article A.2, A.3 and A.5.
- B.4 The regulations of an event shall specify whether Article B.2 or Article B.3 shall apply for the entire event."
What should happen when an illegal move is discovered?	"If a game with reversed colours has ended by normal means (for example checkmate, resignation or draw by agreement), in less than ten (10) moves by both players, then the result stands.
- 7.4 Displaced pieces:
- 7.4.1 If a player displaces one or more pieces, he/she shall re-establish the correct position in his/her own time.
- 7.4.2 If necessary, either the player or h i s / h e r opponent shall pause the chessclock and ask for the arbiter's assistance.
- 7.4.3 The arbiter may penalise the player who displaces the pieces.
Player A's clock is running when Player B accidentally displaces a piece. Player A should not restart Player B's clock but should pause the clock and summon the arbiter. The arbiter may then either add time to A's clock or subtract time from B's clock. If A restarts B's clock this creates several problems with increments being wrongly added and the move counter affected.
Most problems happen in Rapid Chess or Blitz. The penalty should be according to Article 12.9. A player should not be forfeited immediately for accidentally displacing a piece. If he/she did it deliberately, perhaps in order to gain time, or does it several times, that is different.
- 7.5 Illegal moves:
- 7.5.1 An illegal move is completed once the player has pressed his/her clock. If during a game it is found that an illegal move has been completed, the position immediately before the irregularity shall be reinstated. If the position immediately before the irregularity cannot be determined, the game shall continue from the last identifiable position prior to the irregularity. Articles 4.3 and 4.7 apply to the move replacing the illegal move. The game shall then continue from this reinstated position."

What is the exact Elo rating requirement to become a FIDE Master?	"## 0.5 Definitions
In the following text some special terms are used.
Rating refers to a player's Standard FIDE rating
Rating performance is based on the player's result and average rating of opponents (see 1.4.6 to 1.4.8).
Title performance is a result that gives a performance rating as defined in 1.4.6 to 1.4.9 against the minimum average of the opponents, for that title.
GM performance is ≥ 2600 performance against opponents with average rating ≥ 2380.
IM performance is ≥ 2450 performance against opponents with average rating ≥ 2230.
WGM performance is ≥ 2400 performance against opponents with average rating ≥ 2180.
WIM performance is ≥ 2250 performance against opponents with average rating ≥ 2030.
Title norm is a title performance fulfilling additional requirements concerning the mix of titled players and nationalities as specified in articles 1.4.2 to 1.4.5.
Direct title (automatic title) is a title gained by achieving a certain place or result in a tournament. On application by the player's federation and confirmation by the Qualification Commission, such titles are awarded automatically by FIDE.
Until 2014, a nine game GM performance in the Olympiad was considered to be a 13 game GM norm. Now, there is no such rule. The current rule is that a player should have a rating performance of at least 2600 to satisfy one of the conditions to get a GM norm in a tournament. For other norms also, the player should have a specific rating performance."	"## 0.5 Definitions

What happens when a player completes a move but the position remains impossible?	"It is very important that the irregularity must be discovered during the game. After the players have signed the scoresheets or it is clear in another way that the game is over, corrections are not possible. The result stands.
When the irregularity is discovered during the game the game, the game restarts from the restored position. The 'touch move' rule applies so the piece to be played should be, if possible, the one first touched, either the piece illegally moved or the piece captured.
If the irregularity was caused by a check being missed the touched piece should be used to block the check or capture the checking piece, if possible.
A move cannot be declared illegal until the player has completed his/her move by pressing his/her clock. So, the player can correct his/her move without being penalized, even if he/she had already released the piece on the board, provided he/she hasn't pressed the clock. Of course, he/she must comply with the relevant parts of article 4.
If an arbiter observes an illegal move he/she must always intervene immediately. He/She should not wait for a claim to be submitted by a player.

- 7.5.3 If the player presses the clock without making a move, it shall be considered and penalised as if an illegal move.
If a player restarts the opponent's clock instead of pausing it an arbiter may regard this as an accident and punish it less severely.

The player is forfeited if he/she completes two (2) of ANY of the above illegal moves. However when there are two (2) illegal moves in one move (for example illegal castling made by two hands, illegal promotion made by two hands and illegal capturing made by two hands), they count as one (1) illegal move and the player shall not be forfeited, unless it is the second such transgression.
A different situation occurs when a player who previously committed an illegal move, makes another one immediately after the game restarted (which means, at same move number as before).
For example: A white pawn is on d6 and black king on d7, now the player played Ke7 and completed the move. After applying the penalty for the illegal move, he/she played Kc7. They are considered to be two illegal moves.

What are the conditions for checkmate?	"## A.7 Topscorers
Topscorers are players who have a score of over 50% of the maximum possible score when pairing the final round of the tournament.
Such high-scoring players are especially important in the determination of the winner and of the top ranking, even if not all of them are really competing for top ranking places - they are nonetheless likely to be of more importance in the formation of the top standings than low-ranked players, in several collateral ways (e.g., they may be opponents to prospective prize winners, or their score may give a determinant contribute in tiebreak calculations, and so on). Hence, we may apply some special treatment criteria to their pairings - e.g., a player may receive a same colour three times more than the other one, or three times in a row, if this is needed to make them meet an opponent better suited to the strength the player demonstrated."

How does the arbiter handle electronic device violations?	"However, there is the possibility for an arbiter or an organizer to specify in advance (in the regulations of the event) a less severe penalty for a violation of this article (perhaps a fine). They can also include in the regulations of the event the possibility of bringing such a device to the tournament provided that certain conditions are fulfilled: that it is completely switched off and stored in a separate bag, so that it is not in contact with the player and the player does not have access to the bag during the game, without the arbiter's permission (and he/she cannot take the bag with him to the toilet, and so on.).
A player who arrives after the start of a round should be given the opportunity to store his/her device before playing their first move, either with the organiser or placed in a bag, if this is allowed."

What is stalemate and when does it occur?	"- 5.2.2 The game is drawn when a position has arisen in which neither player can checkmate the opponent's king with any series of legal moves. The game is said to end in a 'dead position'. This immediately ends the game, provided that the move producing the position was in accordance with Article 3 and Articles 4.2 - 4.7.
- 5.2.3 The game is drawn upon agreement between the two players during the game, provided both players have made at least one move. This immediately ends the game.
This rule is applicable, only if Article 9.1.1 (not to agree to a draw before a specified number of moves by each player) is not in effect.
The best way to conclude a game is to write down the result on the score sheet (if there is any, see Article 8) and for both players to sign it.

How should the chess clock be handled according to Article 6?	"If a player makes a move with one hand and presses the clock with the other, it is not considered as an illegal move, but it is penalized according to article 12.9.
- 6.2.4 The players must handle the chessclock properly. It is forbidden to press it forcibly, to pick it up, to press the clock before moving or to knock it over. Improper clock handling shall be penalised in accordance with Article 12.9.
Where a player presses the clock without making a move, as mentioned in article 6.2.4, it is considered as an illegal move and it is penalized according to article 7.5.3.
- 6.2.5 Only the player whose clock is running is allowed to adjust the pieces.
- 6.2.6 If a player is unable to use the clock, an assistant, who must be acceptable to the arbiter, may be provided by the player to perform this operation. His/Her clock shall be adjusted by the arbiter in an equitable way. This adjustment of the clock shall not apply to the clock of a player with a disability.
It is clear that the player himself has to provide an assistant. He/She has to introduce this assistant to the arbiter, in advance and not just before the start of the round.

What happens when a flag falls on the chess clock?	"INCREMENT: a specified amount of time added to the players main (thinking) time with each move played. The first increment is added at the start of the game. Often called Fischer Bonus and shown on some clocks as FISCH. If a player moves quickly their time can increase.
There are two types of delay, Bronstein and Simple (or US). With delay a player can never increase their time beyond the amount they had at the start of a move. If the clock is pressed before all of the bonus time has been used, the remaining bonus time is lost. Both delay methods have the same overall effect.
BRONSTEIN DELAY: the clock will add the delay only after the move has been completed. The delay added will be the maximum only if the player used more that time, otherwise, the exact amount of used thinking time will be added.
SIMPLE DELAY: with this mode the main time only starts after the delay countdown expires."	"INCREMENT: a specified amount of time added to the players main (thinking) time with each move played.

When must a player record the moves during a game?	"## 1.6 Colour Difference (CD)
- 1.6.1 A team is said to have (had) a colour (White or Black) in a match if the match was actually played and the player on the first board was scheduled to play with that colour.
- 1.6.2 The colour difference of a team is the number of matches where the team had White minus the number of matches where the team had Black.

## 1.7 Colour Preference
Type A colour preferences are used unless the rules of the team competition specify that either Type B colour preferences shall be used or colour preferences are not to be used at all.

## 1.7.1 Type A colour preferences
- 1) A team has a simple (Type A) colour preference for White if its CD is less than -1, or, being its CD 0 or -1, the team had Black in the last two played matches.
- 2) A team has a simple (Type A) colour preference for Black if its CD is more than +1, or, being its CD 0 or +1, the team had White in the last two played matches.
- 3) In all other situations, the team has no (Type A) colour preference."
When can a player claim a draw by the 50-move rule?	"- 9.2.2 has just appeared, and the player claiming the draw has the move.
- 9.2.3 Positions are considered the same if and only if the same player has the move, pieces of the same kind and colour occupy the same squares and the possible moves of all the pieces of both players are the same. Thus positions are not the same if:
- 9.2.3.1 at the start of the sequence a pawn could have been captured en passant
- 9.2.3.2 a king had castling rights with a rook that has not been moved, but forfeited these after moving. The castling rights are lost only after the king or rook is moved.
Only the player whose move it is, and whose clock is running, is allowed to claim a draw in this way. If the procedure of a draw claim is correct, but the player forgets or doesn't know that he/she shall write his/her intended move, it is advisable that instead of rejecting the claim, the arbiter says 'Make your claim legal', if the player asks how he/she can make his/her claim legal, the arbiter can, according to article 11.2, explains conditions of a correct claim.
The correctness of a claim must be checked in the presence of both players. It is also advisable to replay the game and not to decide by only using the score sheets. If electronic boards are used it is possible to check it on the computer.
- 9.3 The game is drawn, upon a correct claim by a player having the move, if:
- 9.3.1 he/she indicates his/her move, which cannot be changed, by writing it on the paper scoresheet or entering it on the electronic scoresheet and declares to the arbiter his/her intention to make this move which will result in the last 50 moves by each player having been made without the movement of any pawn and without any capture, or"	"- 9.2.2 has just appeared, and the player claiming the draw has the move.

What is the default time for arriving late to a game?	"## 6.6 At the time determined for the start of the game White's clock is started.
In matches and smaller tournaments, where there are enough arbiters to do so, the clocks may be started by the arbiters.
In general, in tournaments with many players the arbiter announces the start of the round and states that White's clock is started. The arbiter then goes round the room checking that White's clock has been started on all boards.
Where the move-counter is used to add time after the first time control (at least 30 moves), it is desirable for arbiters to start all White's clocks.
In large tournaments where the move-counter is used, the Chief Arbiter should decide whether the length of time needed to start all of the clocks justifies this being done by the arbiters rather than by the player. If the players start the clock, when the arbiters go around checking that the clocks have been started, they must also make sure that the clock correctly indicates which player is white."

How should an arbiter handle a quickplay finish situation?	"## Guidelines III. Games without increment including Quickplay Finishes
- III.1 A 'quickplay finish' is the phase of a game when all the remaining moves must be completed in a finite time.
Example 1: According to the tournament regulations of an event, the time control is 2 hours for 30 moves and then 1 hour for the end of the game. The last 1 hour will be played according to the rules of the Quickplay finish.
Example 2: According to the tournament regulations of an event, the time control is 2 hours for the whole game. It means that the whole game will be played according to the rules of the Quickplay finish.
- III.2.1 The Guidelines below concerning the final period of the game including Quickplay Finishes, shall only be used at an event if their use has been announced beforehand.
- III.2.2 These Guidelines shall apply only to standard chess and rapid chess games without increment and not to blitz games.

What is the definition of stalemate?	"- 5.2.2 The game is drawn when a position has arisen in which neither player can checkmate the opponent's king with any series of legal moves. The game is said to end in a 'dead position'. This immediately ends the game, provided that the move producing the position was in accordance with Article 3 and Articles 4.2 - 4.7.
- 5.2.3 The game is drawn upon agreement between the two players during the game, provided both players have made at least one move. This immediately ends the game.
This rule is applicable, only if Article 9.1.1 (not to agree to a draw before a specified number of moves by each player) is not in effect.
The best way to conclude a game is to write down the result on the score sheet (if there is any, see Article 8) and for both players to sign it. This then forms a legal document, but even then, things can go wrong."

When can a player stop recording moves?	"- 8.5 Incomplete scoresheets:
- 8.5.1 If neither player keeps score under Article 8.4, the arbiter or an assistant should try to be present and keep score. In this case, immediately after a flag has fallen the arbiter shall pause the chessclock. Then both players shall update their scoresheets, using the arbiter's or the opponent's scoresheet.
It happens quite often that in this time trouble phase the player asks the arbiter how many moves are left until the time control. The arbiter must not answer this as it would be giving advice. Even if the required number of moves have been made the arbiter should not intervene until after a flag fall. At this point the arbiter should pause the chess-clock and request both players to update their scoresheets. When they are completed the arbiter will restart the clock of the player on the move.

- 4.1 Each move must be played with one hand only.
- 4.2 Adjusting the pieces or other physical contact with a piece:
- 4.2.1 Only the player having the move may adjust one or more pieces on their squares, provided that he/she first expresses his/her intention (for example by saying 'j'adoube' or 'I adjust').
Article 4.2.1 may only be used to correct displaced pieces. If the opponent is not present then an arbiter, if present, should be informed before any adjustment takes place. The player should always announce his/her intention to adjust a piece. If he/she does not do this then the normal touch move rules apply (see 4.3).
- 4.2.2 Any other physical contact with a piece, except for clearly accidental contact, shall be considered to be intent.
- 4.3 Except as provided in Article 4.2.1, if the player having the move touches on the chessboard, with the intention of moving or capturing:

What should happen when an illegal move is discovered?	"This means that the player does not lose the game with the first illegal move, but only with the second, as it is in standard chess. The penalty is the addition of one minute to the opponent, instead of two minutes.
- A.5.3 To claim a win on time, the claimant may pause the chessclock and notify the arbiter. However, the game is drawn if the position is such that the claimant cannot checkmate the player's king by any possible series of legal moves.
If both clocks indicate 0.00, no claim for win on time can be submitted by the players, but the Arbiter shall decide the result of the game by the flag that is shown on one of the clocks. The player whose clock shows this indication loses the game.
- A.5.4 If the arbiter observes both kings are in check, or a pawn stands on the rank furthest from its starting position, he/she shall wait until the next move is completed. Then, if an illegal position is still on the board, he/she shall declare the game drawn.
The arbiter arrives at a board where both kings are in check. If that situation continues after the next move is played the arbiter shall declare the game drawn. If that move removes his/her own king from check but the opponent is still in check then the game continues as it is no longer an illegal position. If the second player remains in check after completing his/her next move the arbiter should declare an illegal move by that player."
What is the touch-move rule according to Article 4?	"According to this rule, if a player has not said 'I adjust' or something similar before touching a piece and touching the piece is not accidental, the touched piece must be moved. For example, if White played 1 Be2xg5 by lifting the bishop and then removing the knight, the bishop on e2 must be moved as it was touched intending to move.
<!-- image -->
The accidental touch doesn't imply a psychological analysis of the player's intentions.
- 4.4 If a player having the move:
- 4.4.1 touches his/her king and a rook he/she must castle on that side if it is legal to do so
- 4.4.2 deliberately touches a rook and then his/her king he/she is not allowed to castle on that side on that move and the situation shall be governed by Article 4.3.1.
In this case the player must move his/her rook, if possible. If no rook move is possible, he/she should move his/her king. (Article 4.3.1)
- 4.4.3 intending to castle, touches the king and then a rook, but castling with this rook is illegal, the player must make another legal move with his/her king (which may include castling with the other rook). If the king has no legal move, the player is free to make any legal move.
Please note that castling is a king move. If a player tries to castle and it is found to be illegal, then the player must make a king move that is legal. If there is no legal move of the king the player is free to make any move - he/she is not obliged to move the rook (but see 4.4.2)."

What happens if both players have made an illegal move?	"## Qualification Commission Title Application Review https://qc.fide.com/2023/05/01/qualification-commission-title-application-review/
At the review of title applications by the Qualification Commission unfortunately some applications are rejected as these do not fulfil the requirements. Below we will address some issues we have encountered at the latest review. This may help arbiters and federation title officials in assessing whether a norm or application may be viable. With this, we hope to avoid disappointments of future applicants.
-  A norm of which the tournament has not (yet) been rated by FIDE, will not be considered.
-  When a player has an overscore in a tournament, the number of games for the title application may be increased, e.g. a norm over 8 rounds with an overscore of one point will count as a norm over 9 rounds. However, in case no norm is scored due to missing a round by a loss by forfeit, an overscore will not create a norm. See 1.4.1.c and 1.4.1.d.
-  Furthermore, in case of two tournaments with each an overscore of 1⁄2 point, this does not increase the number of games. See 1.4.1.d.
-  In tournaments with pre-determined pairings (such as a round robin), a norm must be based on all scheduled rounds. Thus, a norm cannot be based on 9 rounds in a 12player round robin. See 1.4.1.e."
What is the procedure when an illegal move is discovered several moves later?	"- 1.2.3 Terms used in Tables for Direct Titles:
Gold = first after tiebreak 1st equal = maximum 3 best players after tiebreak Norm = 9 games
Regional = Maximum of 3 Junior/Youth events per Continent + Arab Youth Individual
As above, each Continent is allowed to designate a maximum of 3 regional youth/age events for direct titles. The Continent must inform QC of any change in the composition of these regions before the beginning of each year.
Sub-Continentals - include Zonals and Sub-Zonals
Zonals and Sub-Zonals are accepted for direct titles only if they establish direct qualifiers to the World Cup or World Championship.
- 1.2.4 Only events defined in the Table for Direct Titles may award titles under 1.2. Organisers must follow these regulations for Direct Titles and cannot alter them in any way.
- 1.3 Titles may be gained by achieving a published or interim rating at some time (see 1.5.3a). For ratings achieved after 1st July 2017, the player must at that time have played at least 30 rated games:
- 1.3.1 FIDE Master ≥2300
- 1.3.2 Candidate Master ≥2200
- 1.3.3 Women FIDE Master ≥2100
- 1.3.4 Women Candidate Master ≥2000"
What is the procedure when an illegal move is discovered several moves later?	"## Article 4: Sanctions
- 4.1 There are three levels of sanction available to the DSC:
- a. Written warning
For minor breaches, an arbiter sanctioned by a written warning will receive an official letter from DSC, stating the breach and expected corrective measures to be taken by the arbiter.
A written warning remains valid for 12 months.
Failure to apply the expected corrective measures may lead to a more severe penalty.
- b. Written reprimand
For more serious breaches, an arbiter sanctioned by a written reprimand will receive an official letter from DSC, stating the breach and expected corrective measures to be taken by the arbiter.
A written reprimand remains valid for 24 months.
Failure to apply the expected corrective measures may lead to a more severe penalty.
- c. Disqualification
For severe breaches, an arbiter may be disqualified for a specified duration. A disqualification means that the arbiter is ineligible to be appointed or nominated as an arbiter in any FIDE-rated event and/or to officiate at such an event.
- o For a first offence, a disqualification may be up to 18 months.
- o For a subsequent offence, disqualification may be up to 24 months.

## Article 5: Procedural Rules

## 5.1 Register of Cases
All complaints and reports concerning violations of the Arbiters' disciplinary regulation shall be addressed to the Arbiters Commission (ARB). A Register of Cases is set up at the ARB and will contain all cases, whether sanctioned or otherwise, for 10 years. ARB will provide the FIDE Office with the final written decision of DSC.

The working language of DSC is English. All documents should be submitted in English."
When can a player claim a draw by the 50-move rule?	- 4.14 FPL may establish a subcommittee for handling complaints and investigations of cheating allegations ('Legal Department'). The Legal Department should consist of a Chair, a Secretary, and other members who should have a legal background and/or experience in investigating cheating allegations. If a Legal Department is established, its Chair, in consultation with the Secretary, decides on the composition and number of members of an IP on the submission of a complaint to another FIDE Commission on the transfer of a cheating case to an NF and - in agreement with the FPL Chairperson on decisions acc. to art. 4.3.

According to FIDE Laws, at what exact moment is an illegal move considered 'completed'?	"It is very important that the irregularity must be discovered during the game. After the players have signed the scoresheets or it is clear in another way that the game is over, corrections are not possible. The result stands.
When the irregularity is discovered during the game the game, the game restarts from the restored position. The 'touch move' rule applies so the piece to be played should be, if possible, the one first touched, either the piece illegally moved or the piece captured.
If the irregularity was caused by a check being missed the touched piece should be used to block the check or capture the checking piece, if possible.
A move cannot be declared illegal until the player has completed his/her move by pressing his/her clock. So, the player can correct his/her move without being penalized, even if he/she had already released the piece on the board, provided he/she hasn't pressed the clock. Of course, he/she must comply with the relevant parts of article 4.
If an arbiter observes an illegal move he/she must always intervene immediately. He/She should not wait for a claim to be submitted by a player.
- 7.5.2 If the player has moved a pawn to the furthest distant rank, pressed the clock, but not replaced the pawn with a new piece, the move is illegal. The pawn shall be replaced by a queen of the same colour as the pawn.
- 7.5.3 If the player presses the clock without making a move, it shall be considered and penalised as if an illegal move.
If a player restarts the opponent's clock instead of pausing it an arbiter may regard this as an accident and punish it less severely.
For example: Player B makes an illegal move. Player A, instead of pausing the clock, restarts the opponent's clock. Is this an infringement of Article 7.5.3?"

In the column ' move ' the number of the last move that has been played last on this board
In the column ' dif. ' write the difference of column '+' minus 'move'
The 'dif.' values should be equal to: (initial time) minus (time passed until the time of check). In our example is: 90 + 90 - 30 = 150. If we find a different value of ± 2 we have to check thoroughly:
- -if players have missed pressing the clock for some moves
- -if clocks settings are correct
- -if there is a clock malfunction."

How does the knight move according to FIDE Laws?	"3.1.5 The following additional options listed below may be activated and used by the player:
1. Smart move: the player may enter a move by selecting a single square when the chosen move is the only move possible.
2. Pre-move: the player enters a move before the opponent has moved. The move is automatically executed on the virtual board as an immediate response to the opponent's move unless the move is illegal.In most playing zones, if the pre-move is illegal, it will not be played automatically, so there is no penalty.
3. Auto promotion to queen: the player may set up the playing zone to force the promotion to a queen without being offered a choice of the promoted piece.
The arbiter in their introductory remarks, may wish to highlight which of these features are or are not available to the players but is not obliged to do so. If a player is unaware of any such options available, it is their own responsibility.
4. Move confirmation: the player may set up the playing zone to request the player confirm the move before the move is submitted to the playing zone.
2. 3.1.6 All moves and clock times after each move are automatically recorded by the playing zone and visible to both players.
Online chess allows players to record moves and have their clock automatically pressed after they made their move on a virtual chess board &amp; eboard.
- 3.1.7 If a player is unable to move the pieces, an assistant, who shall be acceptable to the arbiter, may be provided by the player to perform this operation.
- 3.2 When eBoards are used:
- 3.2.1 Moves are made on the eBoard in the same way as on a regular chess board."
What is Bronstein time delay?	"It is clear that the player himself has to provide an assistant. He/She has to introduce this assistant to the arbiter, in advance and not just before the start of the round. It is usual that 10 minutes are deducted from the time of the player who needs an assistant. No deduction should be made in the case of a disabled player.
- 6.3 Allotted time:
- 6.3.1 When using a chessclock, each player must complete a minimum number of moves or all moves in an allotted period of time including any additional amount of time added with each move. All these must be specified in advance.
A game may have more than one period. The requirements of the subsequent total number of moves and the additional amount of time with each move for each period must be specified in advance. These parameters should not change during a tournament. A play-off may have different time controls.
- 6.3.2 The time saved by a player during one period is added to his/her time available for the next period, where applicable. In the time-delay mode both players receive an allotted 'main thinking time'. Each player also receives a 'fixed extra time' with every move. The countdown of the main thinking time only commences after the fixed extra time has expired. Provided the player presses his/her clock before the expiration of the fixed extra time, the main thinking time does not change, irrespective of the proportion of the fixed extra time used.
In the Laws of Chess Increment and Delay are treated in the same way. For example, when calculating the length of the playing session both are multiplied by 60 to find the total time.
INCREMENT: a specified amount of time added to the players main (thinking) time with each move played. The first increment is added at the start of the game. Often called Fischer Bonus and shown on some clocks as FISCH. If a player moves quickly their time can increase."	"It is clear that the player himself has to provide an assistant.

In the time-delay mode both players receive an allotted 'main thinking time'. Each player also receives a 'fixed extra time' with every move. The countdown of the main thinking time only commences after the fixed extra time has expired. Provided the player presses his/her clock before the expiration of the fixed extra time, the main thinking time does not change, irrespective of the proportion of the fixed extra time used.
In the Laws of Chess Increment and Delay are treated in the same way. For example, when calculating the length of the playing session both are multiplied by 60 to find the total time.
INCREMENT: a specified amount of time added to the players main (thinking) time with each move played. The first increment is added at the start of the game. Often called Fischer Bonus and shown on some clocks as FISCH. If a player moves quickly their time can increase."
What are the conditions for checkmate?	"## Article 5: The Completion of the Game
- 5.1.1 The game is won by the player who has checkmated his/her opponent's king. This immediately ends the game, provided that the move producing the checkmate position was in accordance with Article 3 and Articles 4.2 - 4.7.
- 5.1.2 The game is lost by the player who declares he/she resigns (this immediately ends the game), unless the position is such that the opponent cannot checkmate the player's king by any possible series of legal moves. In this case the result of the game is a draw.
A player may resign in a number of different ways:
- -pausing the clock
- -announcing his/her resignation
- -knocking over his/her king
- -reaching out his/her hand to the opponent
- -signing the score sheets, and so on.
All of these possibilities are capable of being misinterpreted. Therefore, the situation has to be clarified.
At the end of a game the arbiter should ensure that both scoresheets show the same result. A player who does not wish to continue a game and leaves without resigning - or notifying the arbiter - is being discourteous. He/She may be penalized, at the discretion of the Chief Arbiter, for poor sportsmanship.
- 5.2.1 The game is drawn when the player to move has no legal move and his/her king is not in check. The game is said to end in 'stalemate'. This immediately ends the game, provided that the move producing the stalemate position was in accordance with Article 3 and Articles 4.2 - 4.7."	"## Article 5: The Completion of the Game

What are the exact conditions for a valid en passant capture?	"The number of arbiters required in a competition varies, depending on the kind of event (Individual, Team), on the system of the games (Round Robin, Swiss System, Knock Out, Matches), on the number of participants and on the importance of the event.
Normally one Chief Arbiter, one Deputy Chief Arbiter and a number of arbiters (approximately one for every 20 to 25 players) are appointed for a competition. In special cases (e.g. tiebreak games with adequate supervision), Assistant arbiters may be appointed.
Also, the following requirements can be considered as very important for the arbiters in a competition:
1. To behave in a proper manner with the players, captains and spectators and to be respectful and dignified. Arbiters shall take care to manage any dispute during the games and take care of the good image of the tournament.
2. To observe as many games as possible during every round of the competition. Arbiters have to take care of the games that they are responsible for, to observe and to check the games' progress (especially when there is time trouble). It is not acceptable for the arbiters to leave the playing area every 10 or 15 minutes to smoke or vape, nor for any conversations with friends, spectators, officials, or other persons, nor to leave their sector unattended in order to go and watch other games in another part of the playing hall. It is not acceptable for the arbiters to stay"
What is the penalty for making an illegal move in a standard game?	"For example: Player B makes an illegal move. Player A, instead of pausing the clock, restarts the opponent's clock. Is this an infringement of Article 7.5.3?
In this case Player A had not deliberately started Player B's clock.
Where an opponent's clock may have been started in error the arbiter must decide if this action constitutes an illegal move or a distraction.
- 7.5.4 If a player uses two hands to make a single move (for example in case of castling, capturing or promotion) and pressed the clock, it shall be considered and penalised as if an illegal move.
It is not applicable if the game was ended before the clock was pressed.
- 7.5.5 After the action taken under Article 7.5.1, 7.5.2, 7.5.3 or 7.5.4 for the first completed illegal move by a player, the arbiter shall give two minutes extra time to his/her opponent; for the second completed illegal move by the same player the arbiter shall declare the game lost by this player. However, the game is drawn if the position is such that the opponent cannot checkmate the player's king by any possible series of legal moves.
The arbiter's have to follow the uniformity in reducing the increment (in general 30 seconds) for the player who completed the illegal move by pressing the clock and adding two minutes for his opponent.
In Rapid and Blitz also the increment obtained by pressing the clock has to be reduced accordingly."	"For example: Player B makes an illegal move. Player A, instead of pausing the clock, restarts the opponent's clock. Is this an infringement of Article 7.5.3?

What happens if the initial position was incorrect?	"## Article 7: Irregularities
- 7.1 If an irregularity occurs and the pieces have to be restored to a previous position, the arbiter shall use his/her best judgement to determine the times to be shown on the chessclock. This includes the right not to change the clock times. He/She shall also, if necessary, adjust the clock's move-counter.
- 7.2.1 If during a game it is found that the initial position of the pieces was incorrect, the game shall be cancelled and a new game shall be played.
The error must be discovered before the end of the game otherwise the result will stand. If an electronic board shows this error or stops recording the moves, the operator should inform the arbiter. It is the arbiter's duty to check if such a situation has been caused by an irregularity in play.
- 7.2.2 If during a game it is found that the chessboard has been placed contrary to Article 2.1, the game shall continue but the position reached must be transferred to a correctly placed chessboard.
- 7.3 If a game has started with colours reversed then, if less than 10 moves have been made by both players, it shall be discontinued and a new game played with the correct colours. After 10 moves or more, the game shall continue.
After Black has made move 10 the game shall continue, otherwise, a new game shall be played with the correct colours. It doesn't matter what the current position on the chessboard is and how many pieces or pawns have been captured.

When does the 75-move rule apply for automatic draw?	"## 2.2.2 Inactivity
Lecturers who had not given any FIDE approved Seminar for four (4) consecutive years are called 'inactive'.
Lecturers are expected to have a minimum activity as arbiters in FIDE-rated events. This should be at least one event per year.
Lecturers who are marked inactive as arbiters will also be marked inactive as Lecturers. Inactive Lecturers will be excluded from the list of lecturers, by a decision of the Arbiters' Commission.

## 2.2.3 Renewal
Those at the end of their period of accreditation shall be eligible for reselection.
The FIDE Arbiters' Commission shall confirm the renewal.
Accredited Lecturers who reach the last 6 months of their accreditation and whose accreditation may not be renewed for any reason (inactivity or other) shall be informed by the FIDE Arbiters' Commission. They shall confirm their wish to keep their accreditation and define an action plan together with the commission to reconsider the renewal. Otherwise, the accreditation stops at the end of the 4 years of inactivity.

What is the procedure when an illegal move is discovered several moves later?	"It is very important that the irregularity must be discovered during the game. After the players have signed the scoresheets or it is clear in another way that the game is over, corrections are not possible. The result stands.
When the irregularity is discovered during the game the game, the game restarts from the restored position. The 'touch move' rule applies so the piece to be played should be, if possible, the one first touched, either the piece illegally moved or the piece captured.
If the irregularity was caused by a check being missed the touched piece should be used to block the check or capture the checking piece, if possible.
A move cannot be declared illegal until the player has completed his/her move by pressing his/her clock. So, the player can correct his/her move without being penalized, even if he/she had already released the piece on the board, provided he/she hasn't pressed the clock. Of course, he/she must comply with the relevant parts of article 4.
If an arbiter observes an illegal move he/she must always intervene immediately. He/She should not wait for a claim to be submitted by a player.
- 7.5.2 If the player has moved a pawn to the furthest distant rank, pressed the clock, but not replaced the pawn with a new piece, the move is illegal. The pawn shall be replaced by a queen of the same colour as the pawn.
- 7.5.3 If the player presses the clock without making a move, it shall be considered and penalised as if an illegal move.
If a player restarts the opponent's clock instead of pausing it an arbiter may regard this as an accident and punish it less severely.
For example: Player B makes an illegal move. Player A, instead of pausing the clock, restarts the opponent's clock. Is this an infringement of Article 7.5.3?"

What are the requirements for chess clock settings?	"## 6.10 Chessclock setting:
This means that a simple flag fall might not lead the arbiter to declare the game lost for the player whose flag has fallen. The Arbiter has to check the final position on the chessboard and only if the opponent can checkmate the player's king by any possible series of legal moves, can he/she declare the game won by the opponent. Where there are forced moves that lead to a checkmate or to a stalemate by the player, then the result of the game is declared as a draw. The table below shows a few situations with the corresponding results:
- 6.10.1 Every indication given by the chessclock is considered to be conclusive in the absence of any evident defect. A chessclock with an evident defect shall be replaced by the arbiter, who shall use his/her best judgement when determining the times to be shown on the replacement chessclock.
It is desirable to check the clocks during the round, for instance every 30 minutes, and to record the times and the number of moves made, by using a time-control sheet (see at the end of the Manual), even though the games are broadcast.
This can be particularly valuable when an increment is used.
If a chess-clock must be replaced, it must be done as soon as possible and it is essential to mark it as defective and to separate it from the clocks that work correctly.
- 6.10.2 If during a game it is found that the setting of either or both clocks is incorrect, either player or the arbiter shall pause the chessclock immediately. The arbiter shall install the correct setting and adjust the times and move-counter, if necessary he/she shall use his/her best judgement when determining the clock settings.

What is Fischer time control?	"It is clear that the player himself has to provide an assistant. He/She has to introduce this assistant to the arbiter, in advance and not just before the start of the round. It is usual that 10 minutes are deducted from the time of the player who needs an assistant. No deduction should be made in the case of a disabled player.
- 6.3 Allotted time:
- 6.3.1 When using a chessclock, each player must complete a minimum number of moves or all moves in an allotted period of time including any additional amount of time added with each move. All these must be specified in advance.
A game may have more than one period. The requirements of the subsequent total number of moves and the additional amount of time with each move for each period must be specified in advance. These parameters should not change during a tournament. A play-off may have different time controls.
- 6.3.2 The time saved by a player during one period is added to his/her time available for the next period, where applicable. In the time-delay mode both players receive an allotted 'main thinking time'. Each player also receives a 'fixed extra time' with every move. The countdown of the main thinking time only commences after the fixed extra time has expired. Provided the player presses his/her clock before the expiration of the fixed extra time, the main thinking time does not change, irrespective of the proportion of the fixed extra time used.
In the Laws of Chess Increment and Delay are treated in the same way. For example, when calculating the length of the playing session both are multiplied by 60 to find the total time.
