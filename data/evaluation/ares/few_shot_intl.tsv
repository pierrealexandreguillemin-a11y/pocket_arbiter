How does the arbiter handle electronic device violations?	"However, there is the possibility for an arbiter or an organizer to specify in advance (in the regulations of the event) a less severe penalty for a violation of this article (perhaps a fine). They can also include in the regulations of the event the possibility of bringing such a device to the tournament provided that certain conditions are fulfilled: that it is completely switched off and stored in a separate bag, so that it is not in contact with the player and the player does not have access to the bag during the game, without the arbiter's permission (and he/she cannot take the bag with him to the toilet, and so on.).  
A player who arrives after the start of a round should be given the opportunity to store his/her device before playing their first move, either with the organiser or placed in a bag, if this is allowed."

What are the exact conditions for a valid en passant capture?

Normally one Chief Arbiter, one Deputy Chief Arbiter and a number of arbiters (approximately one for every 20 to 25 players) are appointed for a competition. In special cases (e.g. tiebreak games with adequate supervision), Assistant arbiters may be appointed.  
Also, the following requirements can be considered as very important for the arbiters in a competition:  
1. To behave in a proper manner with the players, captains and spectators and to be respectful and dignified. Arbiters shall take care to manage any dispute during the games and take care of the good image of the tournament.
2. To observe as many games as possible during every round of the competition. Arbiters have to take care of the games that they are responsible for, to observe and to check the games' progress (especially when there is time trouble). It is not acceptable for the arbiters to leave the playing area every 10 or 15 minutes to smoke or vape, nor for any conversations with friends, spectators, officials, or other persons, nor to leave their sector unattended in order to go and watch other games in another part of the playing hall.

If both clocks indicate 0.00, no claim for win on time can be submitted by the players, but the Arbiter shall decide the result of the game by the flag that is shown on one of the clocks. The player whose clock shows this indication loses the game.  
- A.5.4 If the arbiter observes both kings are in check, or a pawn stands on the rank furthest from its starting position, he/she shall wait until the next move is completed. Then, if an illegal position is still on the board, he/she shall declare the game drawn.  
The arbiter arrives at a board where both kings are in check. If that situation continues after the next move is played the arbiter shall declare the game drawn. If that move removes his/her own king from check but the opponent is still in check then the game continues as it is no longer an illegal position.

If a player refuses to cooperate with these obligations, the arbiter shall take measures in accordance with Article 12.9.

If a mobile phone (even switched off) is found with a player, his/her game is immediately lost and the opponent shall win. The result shall be 1-0 or 0-1. It doesn't matter if, when the mobile phone is found, the opponent cannot checkmate the offending player by any series of legal moves: he/she wins the game. The opponent may have cheated earlier.  
It is different if the game has not yet started. Suppose the following situation occurs: There is no zero-tolerance. Player A is in the playing hall at the start of the round. His/Her opponent, Player B is absent. Immediately after player A made his/her first move his/her mobile rings. The arbiter declares the game lost for Player A.

When can a player stop recording moves?	"- 8.5 Incomplete scoresheets:
- 8.5.1 If neither player keeps score under Article 8.4, the arbiter or an assistant should try to be present and keep score. In this case, immediately after a flag has fallen the arbiter shall pause the chessclock. Then both players shall update their scoresheets, using the arbiter's or the opponent's scoresheet.  
It happens quite often that in this time trouble phase the player asks the arbiter how many moves are left until the time control. The arbiter must not answer this as it would be giving advice. Even if the required number of moves have been made the arbiter should not intervene until after a flag fall. At this point the arbiter should pause the chess-clock and request both players to update their scoresheets. When they are completed the arbiter will restart the clock of the player on the move. If a player delays updating his/her scoresheet, sometimes contemplating his/her next move, he/she should be warned."	"- 8.5 Incomplete scoresheets:

How does the arbiter handle displacement of pieces?	"It is very important that the irregularity must be discovered during the game. After the players have signed the scoresheets or it is clear in another way that the game is over, corrections are not possible. The result stands.  
When the irregularity is discovered during the game the game, the game restarts from the restored position. The 'touch move' rule applies so the piece to be played should be, if possible, the one first touched, either the piece illegally moved or the piece captured.  
If the irregularity was caused by a check being missed the touched piece should be used to block the check or capture the checking piece, if possible.  
A move cannot be declared illegal until the player has completed his/her move by pressing his/her clock.

If a player restarts the opponent's clock instead of pausing it an arbiter may regard this as an accident and punish it less severely.
