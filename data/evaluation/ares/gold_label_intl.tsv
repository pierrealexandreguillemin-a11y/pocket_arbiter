Example 1: According to the Tournament Regulations of an event, the time control is 30 minutes for the whole game and 30 seconds increment for each move. That is: for 60 moves we would get 30'+ (30""x 60) = 30' +30' = 60'. Then such a game is considered to be standard chess.
As according to Article A1 ""A Rapid Chess"" is a game where all moves must be completed in more than 10 minutes and less than 60 minutes for each player.
Example 2: According to the Tournament Regulations of an event, the time control is 10 minutes for the whole game and 5 seconds increment for each move. That is: for 60 moves we would get 10'+ (5' x 60) = 10' +5' = 15'. So according to Article A.1 such a game is considered to be Rapid Chess.
When doing these calculations games using delays are treated in the same way.
- A.2 Players do not need to record the moves, but do not lose their rights to claims normally based on a scoresheet. The player can, at any time, ask the arbiter to provide him/her with a scoresheet, in order to write the moves."	"## Appendix A. Rapid chess

How does the knight move according to FIDE Laws?	"## Article 3: The Moves of the Pieces
- 3.1 It is not permitted to move a piece to a square occupied by a piece of the same colour.

If a draw under either of the above conditions is not noticed during the game a player may appeal using the normal appeals procedure."	"In 9.6.1 case, the five times need not be consecutive.

How should a player correctly offer a draw?	"## Article 9: The Drawn Game
- 9.1 Draw offers and event regulations:
- 9.1.1 The regulations of an event may specify that players cannot offer or agree to a draw, whether in less than a specified number of moves or at all, without the consent of the arbiter.
If a competition applies this rule, then the required number of moves or the no agreement at all condition, should be communicated to the players in the invitation to the tournament. It is advisable for the arbiter to repeat the rule before the start of the tournament. It is clear that the rule applies only for draw agreements. Articles 9.2,
9.3 and 9.6 still apply during the whole game and give the possibility to the players to draw in less than the specified number of moves, which must be accepted by the arbiter. For example, if two players claim a draw by three-fold occurrence after 20 moves, in a tournament where there is a draw restriction rule before 30 moves have been completed by both players, then the arbiter must allow the draw. If neither player claims a draw by three-fold occurrence, and an arbiter is aware that the same position (per 9.2.2) has occurred at least 5 times, then he/she must intervene, see Article 9.6.1.
This article does not specify a penalty in case of its violation. Unless the tournament regulations specifies one, the arbiter may act according to art. 12.9.
- 9.1.2 However, if the regulations of an event allow a draw agreement the following shall apply:"	"## Article 9: The Drawn Game

What are the arbiter's duties during a rapid or blitz tournament?	"- A.2 Players do not need to record the moves, but do not lose their rights to claims normally based on a scoresheet. The player can, at any time, ask the arbiter to provide him/her with a scoresheet, in order to write the moves.
Players are allowed to record the moves, but they may stop recording any time they wish. Players may claim a draw without the support of a scoresheet when they are playing on electronic boards. The arbiter also has the right to accept or refuse a claim without scoresheet evidence based on his/her observations.
- A.3 The penalties mentioned in Articles 7 and 9 of the Competitive Rules of Play shall be one minute instead of two minutes.
- A.4 The Competitive Rules of Play shall apply if:
A4.1one arbiter supervises at most three games and
- A4.2 each game is recorded by the arbiter or his/her assistant and, if possible, by electronic means
- A.4.3 The player may at any time, when it is his/her move, ask the arbiter or his/her assistant to show him/her the scoresheet. This may be requested a maximum of five times in a game. More requests shall be considered as a distraction of the opponent.
If a player asks the Arbiter to show him the score sheet, the clock should not be paused.
If the Competition Rules are used they must apply to every round. They cannot be introduced, for example, only for the final.
- A.5 Otherwise the following apply:
- A.5.1 From the initial position, once 10 moves have been completed by each player,

How is checkmate defined according to FIDE rules?	"## Article 5: The Completion of the Game
- 5.1.1 The game is won by the player who has checkmated his/her opponent's king. This immediately ends the game, provided that the move producing the checkmate position was in accordance with Article 3 and Articles 4.2 - 4.7.
- 5.1.2 The game is lost by the player who declares he/she resigns (this immediately ends the game), unless the position is such that the opponent cannot checkmate the player's king by any possible series of legal moves. In this case the result of the game is a draw.
A player may resign in a number of different ways:
- -pausing the clock
- -announcing his/her resignation
- -knocking over his/her king
- -reaching out his/her hand to the opponent
- -signing the score sheets, and so on.
All of these possibilities are capable of being misinterpreted. Therefore, the situation has to be clarified.
At the end of a game the arbiter should ensure that both scoresheets show the same result. A player who does not wish to continue a game and leaves without resigning - or notifying the arbiter - is being discourteous. He/She may be penalized, at the discretion of the Chief Arbiter, for poor sportsmanship.
- 5.2.1 The game is drawn when the player to move has no legal move and his/her king is not in check. The game is said to end in 'stalemate'. This immediately ends the game, provided that the move producing the stalemate position was in accordance with Article 3 and Articles 4.2 - 4.7."	"## Article 5: The Completion of the Game

How much time is added after each move in a rapid game?	"However, there is the possibility for an arbiter or an organizer to specify in advance (in the regulations of the event) a less severe penalty for a violation of this article (perhaps a fine). They can also include in the regulations of the event the possibility of bringing such a device to the tournament provided that certain conditions are fulfilled: that it is completely switched off and stored in a separate bag, so that it is not in contact with the player and the player does not have access to the bag during the game, without the arbiter's permission (and he/she cannot take the bag with him to the toilet, and so on.).
A player who arrives after the start of a round should be given the opportunity to store his/her device before playing their first move, either with the organiser or placed in a bag, if this is allowed."		0
What is the penalty for making an illegal move?	"If a game with reversed colours has ended by normal means (for example checkmate, resignation or draw by agreement), in less than ten (10) moves by both players, then the result stands.
- 7.4 Displaced pieces:
- 7.4.1 If a player displaces one or more pieces, he/she shall re-establish the correct position in his/her own time.
- 7.4.2 If necessary, either the player or h i s / h e r opponent shall pause the chessclock and ask for the arbiter's assistance.
- 7.4.3 The arbiter may penalise the player who displaces the pieces.
Player A's clock is running when Player B accidentally displaces a piece. Player A should not restart Player B's clock but should pause the clock and summon the arbiter. The arbiter may then either add time to A's clock or subtract time from B's clock. If A restarts B's clock this creates several problems with increments being wrongly added and the move counter affected.
Most problems happen in Rapid Chess or Blitz. The penalty should be according to Article 12.9. A player should not be forfeited immediately for accidentally displacing a piece. If he/she did it deliberately, perhaps in order to gain time, or does it several times, that is different.
- 7.5 Illegal moves:
- 7.5.1 An illegal move is completed once the player has pressed his/her clock. If during a game it is found that an illegal move has been completed, the position immediately before the irregularity shall be reinstated. If the position immediately before the irregularity cannot be determined, the game shall continue from the last identifiable position prior to the irregularity. Articles 4.3 and 4.7 apply to the move replacing the illegal move. The game shall then continue from this reinstated position."

How does the arbiter handle displacement of pieces?	"It is very important that the irregularity must be discovered during the game. After the players have signed the scoresheets or it is clear in another way that the game is over, corrections are not possible. The result stands.
When the irregularity is discovered during the game the game, the game restarts from the restored position. The 'touch move' rule applies so the piece to be played should be, if possible, the one first touched, either the piece illegally moved or the piece captured.
If the irregularity was caused by a check being missed the touched piece should be used to block the check or capture the checking piece, if possible.
A move cannot be declared illegal until the player has completed his/her move by pressing his/her clock. So, the player can correct his/her move without being penalized, even if he/she had already released the piece on the board, provided he/she hasn't pressed the clock. Of course, he/she must comply with the relevant parts of article 4.
If an arbiter observes an illegal move he/she must always intervene immediately. He/She should not wait for a claim to be submitted by a player.
- 7.5.2 If the player has moved a pawn to the furthest distant rank, pressed the clock, but not replaced the pawn with a new piece, the move is illegal. The pawn shall be replaced by a queen of the same colour as the pawn.
- 7.5.3 If the player presses the clock without making a move, it shall be considered and penalised as if an illegal move.
If a player restarts the opponent's clock instead of pausing it an arbiter may regard this as an accident and punish it less severely.
For example: Player B makes an illegal move. Player A, instead of pausing the clock, restarts the opponent's clock. Is this an infringement of Article 7.5.3?"

- 0.2 The tournaments to be rated shall be pre-registered by the federation in whose territory it is held and they will be responsible for the submission of results and rating fees. Council may additionally designate these rights and responsibilities to Affiliated Organisations that are representing an autonomous territory which is contained within no more than one Federation.
The tournament and its playing schedule must be registered:
- 0.2.1 Not later than 30 days before the tournament starts, if one of the players in the tournament is rated in excess of 2700, or a female player rated in excess of 2500.

The QC Chairman may refuse to register a tournament.
Exceptions to permit tournaments to be rated even though it is registered later than the prescribed notice period may be granted:
- 0.2.3 Tournaments in category 0.2.1: With the approval of the President
- 0.2.4 Tournaments in category 0.2.2: With the approval of the QC Chairman
All tournaments played under Hybrid conditions as described in 2.1 must be approved individually by the QC Chairman.
In exceptional cases, the FIDE Council (taking into account the QC' advisory opinion) or FIDE President (in regards events with average rating more than 2700) has the right to make a decision to rate the tournaments or individual games that have not been submitted by the national federation."		0
What is the 50-move rule for claiming a draw?	"- 9.2.2 has just appeared, and the player claiming the draw has the move.

Only the player whose move it is, and whose clock is running, is allowed to claim a draw in this way. If the procedure of a draw claim is correct, but the player forgets or doesn't know that he/she shall write his/her intended move, it is advisable that instead of rejecting the claim, the arbiter says 'Make your claim legal', if the player asks how he/she can make his/her claim legal, the arbiter can, according to article 11.2, explains conditions of a correct claim.
The correctness of a claim must be checked in the presence of both players. It is also advisable to replay the game and not to decide by only using the score sheets. If electronic boards are used it is possible to check it on the computer.

- 9.3.1 he/she indicates his/her move, which cannot be changed, by writing it on the paper scoresheet or entering it on the electronic scoresheet and declares to the arbiter his/her intention to make this move which will result in the last 50 moves by each player having been made without the movement of any pawn and without any capture, or"	"- 9.2.2 has just appeared, and the player claiming the draw has the move.

When is move recording required according to FIDE Laws?	"## Article 8: The Recording of the Moves
- 8.1 How the moves shall be recorded:
- 8.1.1 In the course of play each player is required to record his/her own moves and those of his/her opponent in the correct manner, move after move, as clearly and legibly as possible, in one of the following ways:
- 8.1.1.1 by writing in the algebraic notation (Appendix C), on the paper 'scoresheet' prescribed for the competition.
- 8.1.1.2 by entering moves on the FIDE certified 'electronic scoresheet' prescribed for the competition.

Notice that it is normally forbidden to record the move before playing it. Only in the case of a draw claim (Article 9.2. and 9.3) and adjourning is it allowed to do so.
Even if an opponent has only one legal move, this must not be recorded by the player in advance
- 8.1.3 A player may reply to his/her opponent's move before recording it, if he/she so wishes. He/She must record his/her previous move before making another.
- 8.1.4 The scoresheet shall be used only for recording the moves, the times of the clocks, offers of a draw, matters relating to a claim and other relevant data.

What are the conditions for a draw by insufficient material?	"- 5.2.2 The game is drawn when a position has arisen in which neither player can checkmate the opponent's king with any series of legal moves. The game is said to end in a 'dead position'. This immediately ends the game, provided that the move producing the position was in accordance with Article 3 and Articles 4.2 - 4.7.
- 5.2.3 The game is drawn upon agreement between the two players during the game, provided both players have made at least one move. This immediately ends the game.
This rule is applicable, only if Article 9.1.1 (not to agree to a draw before a specified number of moves by each player) is not in effect.
The best way to conclude a game is to write down the result on the score sheet (if there is any, see Article 8) and for both players to sign it.

"However, there is the possibility for an arbiter or an organizer to specify in advance (in the regulations of the event) a less severe penalty for a violation of this article (perhaps a fine). They can also include in the regulations of the event the possibility of bringing such a device to the tournament provided that certain conditions are fulfilled: that it is completely switched off and stored in a separate bag, so that it is not in contact with the player and the player does not have access to the bag during the game, without the arbiter's permission (and he/she cannot take the bag with him to the toilet, and so on.).

- A.6 The regulations of an event shall specify whether Article A.4 or Article A.5 shall apply for the entire event.

## Appendix B. Blitz
- B.1 A 'blitz' game is one where all the moves must be completed in a fixed time of 10 minutes or less for each player; or the allotted time plus 60 times any increment is 10 minutes or less for each player .
According to the Tournament Regulations of an event the time control is 5 minutes for the whole game and 5 seconds increment for each move That is: for 60 moves we would get 5'+ (5'x60) = 5'+5' = 10'. According to Art. B.1 we have a Blitz game.
- B.2 The Competition Rules shall apply if:
- B.2.1 one arbiter supervises one game and
- B.2.2 each game is recorded by the arbiter or his/her assistant and, if possible, by electronic means.
- B.2.3 The player may at any time, when it is his/her move, ask the arbiter or his/her assistant to show him/her the scoresheet. This may be requested a maximum of five times in a game. More requests shall be considered as a distraction of the opponent.
If the Competition Rules are used, they must apply to every round. They cannot be introduced, for example, only for the final.
In both Blitz and Rapid Chess, if the player asks from the Arbiter to see the score sheet, the clock should not be paused.
- B.3 Otherwise, play shall be governed by the Rapid chess Laws as in Article A.2, A.3 and A.5.

What should happen when an illegal move is discovered?	"If a game with reversed colours has ended by normal means (for example checkmate, resignation or draw by agreement), in less than ten (10) moves by both players, then the result stands.
- 7.4 Displaced pieces:
- 7.4.1 If a player displaces one or more pieces, he/she shall re-establish the correct position in his/her own time.
- 7.4.2 If necessary, either the player or h i s / h e r opponent shall pause the chessclock and ask for the arbiter's assistance.
- 7.4.3 The arbiter may penalise the player who displaces the pieces.
Player A's clock is running when Player B accidentally displaces a piece. Player A should not restart Player B's clock but should pause the clock and summon the arbiter. The arbiter may then either add time to A's clock or subtract time from B's clock. If A restarts B's clock this creates several problems with increments being wrongly added and the move counter affected.
Most problems happen in Rapid Chess or Blitz. The penalty should be according to Article 12.9. A player should not be forfeited immediately for accidentally displacing a piece. If he/she did it deliberately, perhaps in order to gain time, or does it several times, that is different.
- 7.5 Illegal moves:
- 7.5.1 An illegal move is completed once the player has pressed his/her clock. If during a game it is found that an illegal move has been completed, the position immediately before the irregularity shall be reinstated. If the position immediately before the irregularity cannot be determined, the game shall continue from the last identifiable position prior to the irregularity. Articles 4.3 and 4.7 apply to the move replacing the illegal move. The game shall then continue from this reinstated position."

What is the exact Elo rating requirement to become a FIDE Master?	"## 0.5 Definitions
In the following text some special terms are used.
Rating refers to a player's Standard FIDE rating
Rating performance is based on the player's result and average rating of opponents (see 1.4.6 to 1.4.8).
Title performance is a result that gives a performance rating as defined in 1.4.6 to 1.4.9 against the minimum average of the opponents, for that title.
GM performance is ≥ 2600 performance against opponents with average rating ≥ 2380.
IM performance is ≥ 2450 performance against opponents with average rating ≥ 2230.
WGM performance is ≥ 2400 performance against opponents with average rating ≥ 2180.
WIM performance is ≥ 2250 performance against opponents with average rating ≥ 2030.
Title norm is a title performance fulfilling additional requirements concerning the mix of titled players and nationalities as specified in articles 1.4.2 to 1.4.5.
Direct title (automatic title) is a title gained by achieving a certain place or result in a tournament. On application by the player's federation and confirmation by the Qualification Commission, such titles are awarded automatically by FIDE.
Until 2014, a nine game GM performance in the Olympiad was considered to be a 13 game GM norm. Now, there is no such rule. The current rule is that a player should have a rating performance of at least 2600 to satisfy one of the conditions to get a GM norm in a tournament. For other norms also, the player should have a specific rating performance."	"## 0.5 Definitions

What happens when a player completes a move but the position remains impossible?	"It is very important that the irregularity must be discovered during the game. After the players have signed the scoresheets or it is clear in another way that the game is over, corrections are not possible. The result stands.
When the irregularity is discovered during the game the game, the game restarts from the restored position. The 'touch move' rule applies so the piece to be played should be, if possible, the one first touched, either the piece illegally moved or the piece captured.
If the irregularity was caused by a check being missed the touched piece should be used to block the check or capture the checking piece, if possible.
A move cannot be declared illegal until the player has completed his/her move by pressing his/her clock. So, the player can correct his/her move without being penalized, even if he/she had already released the piece on the board, provided he/she hasn't pressed the clock. Of course, he/she must comply with the relevant parts of article 4.
If an arbiter observes an illegal move he/she must always intervene immediately. He/She should not wait for a claim to be submitted by a player.

If a player restarts the opponent's clock instead of pausing it an arbiter may regard this as an accident and punish it less severely.

The player is forfeited if he/she completes two (2) of ANY of the above illegal moves. However when there are two (2) illegal moves in one move (for example illegal castling made by two hands, illegal promotion made by two hands and illegal capturing made by two hands), they count as one (1) illegal move and the player shall not be forfeited, unless it is the second such transgression.
A different situation occurs when a player who previously committed an illegal move, makes another one immediately after the game restarted (which means, at same move number as before).
For example: A white pawn is on d6 and black king on d7, now the player played Ke7 and completed the move. After applying the penalty for the illegal move, he/she played Kc7. They are considered to be two illegal moves.

What are the conditions for checkmate?	"## A.7 Topscorers
Topscorers are players who have a score of over 50% of the maximum possible score when pairing the final round of the tournament.
Such high-scoring players are especially important in the determination of the winner and of the top ranking, even if not all of them are really competing for top ranking places - they are nonetheless likely to be of more importance in the formation of the top standings than low-ranked players, in several collateral ways (e.g., they may be opponents to prospective prize winners, or their score may give a determinant contribute in tiebreak calculations, and so on). Hence, we may apply some special treatment criteria to their pairings - e.g., a player may receive a same colour three times more than the other one, or three times in a row, if this is needed to make them meet an opponent better suited to the strength the player demonstrated."		0

How does the arbiter handle electronic device violations?	"However, there is the possibility for an arbiter or an organizer to specify in advance (in the regulations of the event) a less severe penalty for a violation of this article (perhaps a fine). They can also include in the regulations of the event the possibility of bringing such a device to the tournament provided that certain conditions are fulfilled: that it is completely switched off and stored in a separate bag, so that it is not in contact with the player and the player does not have access to the bag during the game, without the arbiter's permission (and he/she cannot take the bag with him to the toilet, and so on.).

What is stalemate and when does it occur?	"- 5.2.2 The game is drawn when a position has arisen in which neither player can checkmate the opponent's king with any series of legal moves. The game is said to end in a 'dead position'. This immediately ends the game, provided that the move producing the position was in accordance with Article 3 and Articles 4.2 - 4.7.
- 5.2.3 The game is drawn upon agreement between the two players during the game, provided both players have made at least one move. This immediately ends the game.
This rule is applicable, only if Article 9.1.1 (not to agree to a draw before a specified number of moves by each player) is not in effect.
The best way to conclude a game is to write down the result on the score sheet (if there is any, see Article 8) and for both players to sign it.

What happens when a flag falls on the chess clock?	"INCREMENT: a specified amount of time added to the players main (thinking) time with each move played. The first increment is added at the start of the game. Often called Fischer Bonus and shown on some clocks as FISCH. If a player moves quickly their time can increase.
There are two types of delay, Bronstein and Simple (or US). With delay a player can never increase their time beyond the amount they had at the start of a move. If the clock is pressed before all of the bonus time has been used, the remaining bonus time is lost. Both delay methods have the same overall effect.
BRONSTEIN DELAY: the clock will add the delay only after the move has been completed. The delay added will be the maximum only if the player used more that time, otherwise, the exact amount of used thinking time will be added.
SIMPLE DELAY: with this mode the main time only starts after the delay countdown expires."	"INCREMENT: a specified amount of time added to the players main (thinking) time with each move played.

When must a player record the moves during a game?	"## 1.6 Colour Difference (CD)
- 1.6.1 A team is said to have (had) a colour (White or Black) in a match if the match was actually played and the player on the first board was scheduled to play with that colour.
- 1.6.2 The colour difference of a team is the number of matches where the team had White minus the number of matches where the team had Black.

## 1.7 Colour Preference
Type A colour preferences are used unless the rules of the team competition specify that either Type B colour preferences shall be used or colour preferences are not to be used at all.

## 1.7.1 Type A colour preferences
- 1) A team has a simple (Type A) colour preference for White if its CD is less than -1, or, being its CD 0 or -1, the team had Black in the last two played matches.
- 2) A team has a simple (Type A) colour preference for Black if its CD is more than +1, or, being its CD 0 or +1, the team had White in the last two played matches.

- 9.2.3.2 a king had castling rights with a rook that has not been moved, but forfeited these after moving. The castling rights are lost only after the king or rook is moved.
Only the player whose move it is, and whose clock is running, is allowed to claim a draw in this way. If the procedure of a draw claim is correct, but the player forgets or doesn't know that he/she shall write his/her intended move, it is advisable that instead of rejecting the claim, the arbiter says 'Make your claim legal', if the player asks how he/she can make his/her claim legal, the arbiter can, according to article 11.2, explains conditions of a correct claim.
The correctness of a claim must be checked in the presence of both players. It is also advisable to replay the game and not to decide by only using the score sheets. If electronic boards are used it is possible to check it on the computer.

- 9.3.1 he/she indicates his/her move, which cannot be changed, by writing it on the paper scoresheet or entering it on the electronic scoresheet and declares to the arbiter his/her intention to make this move which will result in the last 50 moves by each player having been made without the movement of any pawn and without any capture, or"	"- 9.2.2 has just appeared, and the player claiming the draw has the move.

What is the default time for arriving late to a game?	"## 6.6 At the time determined for the start of the game White's clock is started.
In matches and smaller tournaments, where there are enough arbiters to do so, the clocks may be started by the arbiters.
In general, in tournaments with many players the arbiter announces the start of the round and states that White's clock is started. The arbiter then goes round the room checking that White's clock has been started on all boards.
Where the move-counter is used to add time after the first time control (at least 30 moves), it is desirable for arbiters to start all White's clocks.
In large tournaments where the move-counter is used, the Chief Arbiter should decide whether the length of time needed to start all of the clocks justifies this being done by the arbiters rather than by the player. If the players start the clock, when the arbiters go around checking that the clocks have been started, they must also make sure that the clock correctly indicates which player is white."

How should an arbiter handle a quickplay finish situation?	"## Guidelines III. Games without increment including Quickplay Finishes
- III.1 A 'quickplay finish' is the phase of a game when all the remaining moves must be completed in a finite time.
Example 1: According to the tournament regulations of an event, the time control is 2 hours for 30 moves and then 1 hour for the end of the game. The last 1 hour will be played according to the rules of the Quickplay finish.
Example 2: According to the tournament regulations of an event, the time control is 2 hours for the whole game. It means that the whole game will be played according to the rules of the Quickplay finish.
- III.2.1 The Guidelines below concerning the final period of the game including Quickplay Finishes, shall only be used at an event if their use has been announced beforehand.
- III.2.2 These Guidelines shall apply only to standard chess and rapid chess games without increment and not to blitz games.

- III.3.1.1 the game shall continue if this occurs in any period of the game except the last period.
- III.3.1.2 the game is drawn if this occurs in the period of a game in which all remaining moves must be completed.
- III.4 If the player having the move has less than two minutes left on his/her clock, he/she may request that an increment extra five seconds be introduced for both players.

If a mobile phone (even switched off) is found with a player, his/her game is immediately lost and the opponent shall win. The result shall be 1-0 or 0-1. It doesn't matter if, when the mobile phone is found, the opponent cannot checkmate the offending player by any series of legal moves: he/she wins the game. The opponent may have cheated earlier.

His/Her opponent, Player B is absent. Immediately after player A made his/her first move his/her mobile rings. The arbiter declares the game lost for Player A. Some minutes later, but still on time, Player B arrives. The score is '-/+', it is not a 'played' game and it cannot be rated."	1
